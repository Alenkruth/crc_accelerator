# crc_accelerator
A parameterizable CRC accelerator written in System Verilog.

## Changelog
2023-04-19: The current version is unoptimized. The design was synthesizable
on Xilinx Vivado 2021 with the Zynq 7000 as the target. The design is also
simulable on ModelSim. The design does not synthesize with Yosys on the OpenLane
flow.
